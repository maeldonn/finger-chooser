# Finger Chooser (Nuxt)

This is the Nuxt 4 port of the **Finger Chooser** application from `@finger-chooser`.  
It reproduces the same landing page, QR call-to-action, and multi-touch game logic with Vue 3 + Nuxt.

## Getting Started

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# run in development mode
npm run dev

# build for production
npm run build

# preview the production build
npm run preview
```

## Environment

- Tailwind CSS powers the utility-first styling (loaded via `@nuxtjs/tailwindcss`).
- The landing page QR code uses [`qrcode.vue`](https://github.com/scopewu/qrcode.vue).
- Lucide icons come from [`lucide-vue-next`](https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide).
